record useful materials for learning machine learning as a beginner

12/10/2020  A visual introduction to machine learning (using decision tree as an example) http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/
            High Level Takeaway: overall model error = bias (overly simple) + variance (over fitting); there will always be errors for decision tree.



12/17/2020 Why my ML model is not working? https://towardsdatascience.com/hint-model-complexity-problem-complexity-and-sample-size-should-be-in-line-c12e73b498a6
            High Level Takeaway:  three components that should be commensurate with each other to make an ML model work: problem complexity, model complexity, and sample size.
